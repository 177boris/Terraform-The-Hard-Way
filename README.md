# Terraform-The-Hard-Way

This tutorial contains a full explanation of how to use Terraform in today's world. Although there may be a lot of content out there for Terraform, it doesn't teach you how to think about Terraform with a developer hat on. I promise you that thinking about Terraform as a developer, even if you aren't one, will **100 percent** put you ahead of many engineers out there.

You don't need to be a computer science major or a software engineer. You'll simply need to tweak your mindset a bit, very-much like we all do in the tech space as it changes.

This project will be prepared for anyone to digest. Don't worry, you don't have to feel intimidated because you're new to Infrastructure-as-Code. We'll be with you every step of the way.

With this project, you'll have the chance to not only help yourself as an engineer, but make a huge difference from an infrastructure and systems development perspective for all organizations.

Learn about how to create real-world solutions for setting up an environment that is using DevOps technologies and practices for deploying apps and cloud services/cloud infrastructure to AWS.

The repository contains free labs, documentation, diagrams, and docs for setting up an entire workflow and DevOps environment from a real-world perspective in AWS.

## The Scenario

For this *The Hard Way* series, there will be two scenarios;
1. New to Terraform
2. Already using Terraform, but aren't super advanced

This project will cover both scenarios.

The first scenario is you're just getting started with Terraform, so you're still a bit green. It's the perfect time to learn.

The second scenario is maybe you've used Terraform a little bit for your work, or maybe you've seen Terraform being used, but you don't know the ins and outs of it.

## Technologies Used

1. AWS
    - AWS will be used to host the application, cloud infrastructure, and any other services we may need.
2. GitHub
    - To store the application and infrastructure/automation code
3. Terraform
   - Create all aspects of the automated systems and services in the cloud

## Labs
1. The Basics - Getting started with Terraform and understanding the concepts. Although this may be a lot of theory, it's super crucial for anyone that wants to be a true master at Terraform in the Infrastructure-as-Code space.
