# Terraform-The-Hard-Way

This tutorial contains a full explanation of how to use Terraform. Although there may be a lot of content out there for Terraform, a lot of it doesn't teach you how to think about Terraform with a developer hat on. I promise you that thinking about Terraform as a developer, even if you aren't one, will **100 percent** put you ahead of many engineers out there. 

With this project, you'll have the chance to not only help yourself as an engineer, but make a huge difference from an infrastructure and systems development perspective for all organizations.

Learn about how to create real-world solutions for setting up an environment that is using DevOps technologies and practices for deploying apps and cloud services/cloud infrastructure to AWS.

The repository contains free labs, documentation, diagrams, and docs for setting up an entire workflow and DevOps environment from a real-world perspective in AWS.
